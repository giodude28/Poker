            "\t-Make the best card: The player with the best card (or the player who makes all other players fold) wins the pot! It's that simple.\n" +
            "\t-Betting as much as possible: Four betting rounds, any player can put all the chips in the middle at any time. That's the charm of no-limit poker. The stack doubled (or \ttripled!) is always only one hand away, and complete destruction is only one hand away.\n" +

            "There are many other great poker games, but in terms of simplicity and absolute popularity, no-limit Texas Hold'em is paramount. The game uniquely combines strategy, psychology, random chance and number operations, which is unmatched by any other popular game.",
    "Before we start with some basic rules of how to play poker, you should first be familiar with the basic poker hand levels. Maybe 90% of beginner mistakes happen when someone thinks they have winning playing cards but not.\n" +

            "7.Three (three kinds of cards have the same value, such as 5-5-5)\n" +
            "8.Two pairs (two pairs, such as 9-9 and 5-5)\n" +

            "\n" +
            "All players can only play with the money in front of the table, but they can get up and leave at any time. If the player loses all the money, he or she can get more and sit on the table again.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "On the other hand, the buy-in amount of the poker tournament is fixed, all the money paid by the players is collected into the prize pool (minus a small part of the organizer's fee. Multiple players are used to accommodate all the players, each from the same Starting chips start\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The shutters are small, but gradually increase over time. This forces players to take action, otherwise they will run out of chips. When the player loses all his chips, the tables will merge until only one table remains.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The player at that table collects all the chips from other players and is the winner of the game. The top 10-15% of finalists will receive an increasing share of the prize pool (predetermined by the tournament organizer), while the winners will receive approximately 25-30% of the prize money.",

            "\n" +
            "In a standard nine-handed table, you should only play 18-20% of your hands. In the beginning, you usually want to perform well.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But what is a good hand? You can start with 9-9, T-T, J-J, Q-Q, K-K, A-A and A-J, A-Q and A-K. If you are competing with fewer than eight other opponents, you can relax the range.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Also: try to avoid making too many calls. Telephone is one of the favorite games of novices. The reason is easy to understand: new players are not sure what they actually have and whether it is beneficial.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Novice poker players would rather call than bet because they don't want to risk a stronger hand than initially thought.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But this is about poker: betting is more effective than betting. how did it get here? You can win the pot without betting. You cannot do the same thing by calling. It's that simple.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In addition, experienced poker players will drive beginner poker players. Once experienced poker players find a good card, they will bet the right amount of bet on each street, because the rookie will pay it off on each street.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "For all these reasons, it is worth betting or reraising even if you are not entirely willing to do so.",
    "Without knowing the background of a hand, you cannot say which hand you want to win at will, but some hands are easier to win than others.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Suppose you have five cents. The flop is A-8-5. This is almost an ideal flop because your hand is very hidden. It will be difficult for people to put you on that precise hand and may even lose a pair of big hands.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "You can make the same argument about straight houses and full houses. On the other hand, some hands are difficult to cover. If you travel one-fifth (you have one-fifth in your hand and two on the boat), many people will expect two-thirds.\n" +

            "Straight flushes are equally applicable and easy to recognize even for beginners (although you may find people with lower straight flushes, which is great).\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Position is very important in poker!\n" +
            "What position are you asking? This is the order in which players are forced to bet/bet. After the flop, the order always starts from the player to the left of the dealer.\n" +

            "If players keep betting, then they are likely to be playing some bad hands. Likewise, if the player keeps folds, then you can assume that they are just playing fairly strong hands.
